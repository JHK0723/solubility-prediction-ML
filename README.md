# Solubility ML Benchmark

This repository presents a machine learning project to predict the aqueous solubility (logS) of molecules using molecular descriptors. It implements and evaluates three regression modelsâ€”linear Regression, Random Forest, and a manually coded K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)â€”to benchmark their performance on this important chemical dataset.

Predicting molecular solubility is crucial in drug discovery and chemistry, as it affects compound absorption and bioavailability. This project compares classical and ensemble ML techniques alongside a manual implementation of KNN, providing insights into model strengths and interpretability.

## Models implemented:
- Linear Regression: Establishes a linear baseline relationship between features and solubility.
- Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- Manual K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A distance-based algorithm implemented from scratch to demonstrate fundamental machine learning principles.

## Dataset:
- Source: Delaney solubility dataset with molecular descriptors [Delaney Solubility Dataset CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/data/refs/heads/master/delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv)

- Format: CSV file containing molecular features and the target variable `logS` (logarithm of solubility)

Evaluation metrics used include MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) on both training and testing sets.

## Visualizations:
- Linear Regression: Actual vs Predicted (TEST)

| Model             | Train MAE | Train RMSE | Train MAPE (%) | Test MAE | Test RMSE | Test MAPE (%) |
|------------------|-----------|------------|----------------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Linear Regression| 0.5334    | 0.6937     | 9.68           | 0.5726   | 0.7631    | 10.25          |
| Random Forest     | 0.1402    | 0.2353     | 2.59           | 0.4729   | 0.6662    | 8.24           |
| Manual KNN        | 0.5742    | 0.7235     | 10.43          | 0.6443   | 0.8205    | 11.73          |

The Random Forest model achieved the best performance across all metrics on both training and test sets. It significantly outperformed the other models, especially in reducing error and improving predictive accuracy. Linear Regression showed moderate performance, while the manual KNN model underperformed, suggesting limitations in capturing the underlying data structure.
